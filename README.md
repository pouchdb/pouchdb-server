# pouchdb-server

> A standalone REST interface server for PouchDB.

## Introduction

**pouchdb-server** is a simple Node.js server that presents a simple REST API, which mimics that of [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org),
on top of [PouchDB](http://pouchdb.com). Among other things, this allows users to replicate IndexedDB stores to LevelDB, or to
spin up a quick and dirty drop-in replacement for CouchDB to get things moving quickly.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install -g pouchdb-server
```

## Usage

```

   Usage: pouchdb-server [options]

   Options:
     -p, --port           Port on which to run the server.
     -d, --dir            Where to store database files (defaults to current directory)
     -m, --in-memory      Use a pure in-memory database (will be deleted upon reboot!)
     -l, --log            Connect log format.
     -h, --help           Show this usage information.
     -u, --user           Set Basic Auth username. (Both user and pass required for Basic Auth).
     -s, --pass           Set Basic Auth password. (Both user and pass required for Basic Auth).

```

A simple example might be,

```bash
$ pouchdb-server -p 15984 -l tiny
pouchdb-server listening on port 15984.
```

Take a look at the possible log formats [here](http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/middleware-logger.html). 
Alternatively, **pouchdb-server**'s functionality can be mounted into other Express web apps. For more information
on that, check out [express-pouchdb](https://github.com/nick-thompson/express-pouchdb).

## Basic Auth

**pouchdb-server** supports a read-only authentication scheme with Basic Auth 
out of the box. Usage is simple:
```bash
$ pouchdb-server --user=nick --pass=secret &
$ curl -X PUT http://localhost:5984/test
PUT /test 401 4ms - 12b
Unauthorized.
$ curl --user nick:secret -X PUT http://localhost:5984/test
PUT /test 201 815ms - 16b
{
  "ok": true
}
```

If you need a more involved authentication option, it's encouraged that you mount
[express-pouchdb](https://github.com/nick-thompson/express-pouchdb) into a custom application.

## Fauxton

**pouchdb-server** currently supports an experimental version of CouchDB's [Fauxton](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/latest/fauxton/index.html). Fauxton, the successor to CouchDB's original Futon, is a simple web UI for interacting with your databases. With your server running, navigate to `/_utils` to check it out!

## Testing

One of the primary benefits of **pouchdb-server** is the ability to run PouchDB's Node test suite against itself.
To do that, you can simply,

```bash
$ pouchdb-server &
$ grunt test:pouchdb
```

Additionally, we've started porting CouchDB's JavaScript test harness to 
[a simple Node module](https://github.com/nick-thompson/couchdb-harness), which can be run against PouchDB via
**pouchdb-server**.

```bash
$ pouchdb-server &
$ grunt test:couchdb
```

**Note**, you can also specify specific test files to run from CouchDB's harness: `$ grunt test:couchdb:basics:all_docs`

## Contributing

Want to help me make this thing awesome? Great! Here's how you should get started.

1. First, make sure that the bugfix or feature you're looking to implement isn't better fit for [express-pouchdb](https://github.com/nick-thompson/express-pouchdb).
2. PouchDB is still developing rapidly. If you need bleeding egde versions, you should first read how to [set up express-pouchdb for local development](https://github.com/nick-thompson/express-pouchdb#contributing). (Make sure that, afterwards, you `npm link` express-pouchdb).
3. Go ahead and fork **pouchdb-server**, clone it to your machine.
4. Now you'll want to, from the root of **pouchdb-server**, `npm link express-pouchdb`.
5. `npm install` the rest of the dependencies.

Please make your changes on a separate branch whose name reflects your changes, push them to your fork, and open a pull request!
I haven't defined a formal styleguide, so please take care to maintain the existing coding style.
